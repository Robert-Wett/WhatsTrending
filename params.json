{"name":"What's Trending","tagline":"A web app that grabbed the top ten trends based on GEOID and pulled a definition from Urban Dicitonary for each.","body":"# WhatsTrending\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n##### Deprecated via Twitters v1.1 API\r\n\r\nHere's the original description:\r\n\r\nThe words in the title are the current top ten trending terms on [twitter](http://www.twitter.com), for whatever location you choose in the drop-down (by default we are using U.S.A.). Underneath are the results we get when we cross-reference [UrbanDictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com). The original idea was to try and make sense of some of the random people, places, terms, and things that trend on [twitter](http://www.twitter.com) throughout the day that might not exactly be in Merriam-Webster. The results can be funny, informative, random, useless (#hardtosplit), offensive, or a healthy mixture of them all. On the right-hand side, you'll see a table (not on mobile) that holds all the trends you've loaded in the session. You can click on \"Location\", or \"Trend Name\" to sort them descending/ascending alphabetically. Try loading different locations from the drop-down at the top and see what trends they share, and which ones are 'local'.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
